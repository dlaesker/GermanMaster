# German Master
This is a (still in its infancy) german language-learning application in a flashcard-style that allows you to hear the german words being displayed and record/hear yourself pronounced words. Unfortunately, support is only given by the Chrome Browser at the moment. However, I would to extend that in future iterations of the project. Check out the project [here](https://dlaesker.github.io/GermanMaster/index)!
